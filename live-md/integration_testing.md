## **Integration Testing: "Do Components Work Together?"**

### **What is Integration Testing?**

Integration testing verifies that **different modules/services communicate correctly** when combined.

Component A works alone ✅

Component B works alone ✅

But do A and B work TOGETHER? ← Integration Test

### **Real-World Analogy:**

**Like testing a new bridge between two cities:**

Individual Tests:

✓ City A's road system works

✓ City B's road system works

✓ Bridge structure is sound

Integration Test:

? Can cars actually drive from City A to City B via bridge?

? Do traffic signals coordinate properly?

? Do road signs align at connection points?

### **Integration Testing Example: E-commerce Order**

Components involved:

1\. \[Frontend\] \- User Interface

2\. \[Auth Service\] \- User authentication

3\. \[Product Service\] \- Product catalog

4\. \[Cart Service\] \- Shopping cart

5\. \[Payment Service\] \- Payment processing

6\. \[Inventory Service\] \- Stock management

7\. \[Email Service\] \- Order confirmation

Integration Test: "Place an Order"

Step 1: Frontend → Auth Service

  Action: User logs in

  Verify: Auth token returned

  Verify: Frontend stores token ✅

Step 2: Frontend → Product Service

  Action: User searches products

  Verify: Product list returned with prices

  Verify: Frontend displays correctly ✅

Step 3: Frontend → Cart Service (with Auth)

  Action: User adds product to cart

  Verify: Auth token validated

  Verify: Item added to user's cart

  Verify: Cart total calculated ✅

Step 4: Cart Service → Inventory Service

  Action: Check stock availability

  Verify: Real-time stock checked

  Verify: Cart shows "In Stock" or "Low Stock" ✅

Step 5: Frontend → Payment Service

  Action: User enters payment info

  Verify: Payment processed

  Verify: Transaction ID returned ✅

Step 6: Payment Service → Inventory Service

  Action: Deduct inventory

  Verify: Stock count decremented

  Verify: No overselling ✅

Step 7: Order Service → Email Service

  Action: Send confirmation email

  Verify: Email contains order details

  Verify: User receives email ✅

Integration points tested:

✓ Auth token passed between services

✓ Product IDs match across services

✓ Price consistency

✓ Transaction atomicity (all or nothing)

✓ Data format compatibility

### **Types of Integration Testing:**

#### **1\. Big Bang Integration**

Test all components together at once:

Pros: Fast to set up

Cons: Hard to debug when something fails

#### **2\. Incremental Integration**

Test pairs,

then gradually add more:

Pros: Easy to isolate issues

Cons: Takes more time

#### **3\. Top-Down Integration**

Start from UI, stub lower components:

Test top-level flow first, replace stubs incrementally

#### **4\. Bottom-Up Integration**

Start from database, build up:

### **Common Integration Issues Caught:**

❌ Data format mismatch

Service A sends: { "date": "2024-01-15" }

Service B expects: { "date": "01/15/2024" }

Result: Parse error\! 💥

❌ Authentication token expired

Service A: Calls Service B after 1 hour

Service B: "Token expired"

Result: Request fails\! 💥

❌ Race condition

Service A: Updates inventory

Service B: Reads inventory (at same time)

Result: Wrong stock count\! 💥

❌ Timeout

Service A: Waits for Service B response

Service B: Takes 60 seconds

Service A: Timeout at 30 seconds

Result: Request fails\! 💥

**Key characteristics:**

* 🔗 **Component interaction:** Focus on interfaces between services
* 🎭 **Can use mocks/stubs:** Replace some components during testing
* 🐛 **Catches integration bugs:** Finds issues unit tests miss
* ⚙️ **API contracts:** Verifies services speak same language
