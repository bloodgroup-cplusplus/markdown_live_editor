## **🖥️ System Testing:** 

System testing verifies the **entire integrated system** meets requirements, testing it as a complete product.

System Testing \= Integration Testing \+ Full Environment

Not just: Do services talk to each other?  
But: Does the entire system work in production-like environment?

### **Real-World Analogy:**

**Like testing an entire airplane before first passenger flight:**

Component Testing: Each part tested (✅ done)  
Integration Testing: Parts work together (✅ done)

System Testing: Complete airplane test  
✓ Can it taxi on runway?  
✓ Can it take off?  
✓ Can it fly at cruising altitude?  
✓ Can it land safely?  
✓ Do all systems work together (navigation, fuel, hydraulics)?  
✓ Can it handle turbulence?

Test the COMPLETE system as passengers will experience it\!

### **System Test Example: Banking Application**

System Under Test:  
\- Web frontend (React)  
\- Mobile app (iOS/Android)  
\- API gateway  
\- Authentication service  
\- Account service  
\- Transaction service  
\- Notification service  
\- Database cluster  
\- Message queue  
\- External payment gateway

System Test Scenario: "Fund Transfer"

Prerequisites:  
✓ Production-like environment deployed  
✓ Test data loaded (accounts, balances)  
✓ All services running  
✓ External systems configured (mocked or sandbox)

Test Steps:

1\. User logs in via web app  
   Verify: ✓ Session created  
   Verify: ✓ Dashboard loads with account balance

2\. User navigates to transfer page  
   Verify: ✓ Account list populated  
   Verify: ✓ Available balance correct

3\. User initiates transfer ($500)  
   Input: Recipient account, amount, note  
   Verify: ✓ Validation works (sufficient funds)  
   Verify: ✓ Confirmation screen shown

4\. User confirms transfer  
   Verify: ✓ Transaction processes  
   Verify: ✓ Sender balance decreases  
   Verify: ✓ Recipient balance increases  
   Verify: ✓ Transaction logged in database

5\. System sends notifications  
   Verify: ✓ SMS sent to sender  
   Verify: ✓ Email sent to sender  
   Verify: ✓ Push notification to mobile app

6\. User checks mobile app  
   Verify: ✓ Transaction appears in history  
   Verify: ✓ Balance updated  
   Verify: ✓ Transaction details correct

7\. System processes batch jobs (overnight)  
   Verify: ✓ Daily summary generated  
   Verify: ✓ Audit logs created  
   Verify: ✓ Compliance reports generated

All components working together in complete system\! ✅

### **Types of System Testing:**

#### **1\. Functional System Testing**

Test: Complete business workflows  
\- User registration flow  
\- Purchase flow  
\- Refund flow  
\- Account closure flow

Each flow touches multiple subsystems

#### **2\. Non-Functional System Testing**

Test: System qualities  
\- Performance (response times under load)  
\- Security (penetration testing)  
\- Usability (can users navigate easily?)  
\- Reliability (uptime, error rates)  
\- Scalability (handles growth?)

#### **3\. Recovery Testing**

Test: System recovery from failures

Simulate failures:  
1\. Kill database mid-transaction  
   Expected: ✓ Transaction rolled back  
   Expected: ✓ User sees error message  
   Expected: ✓ System remains stable

2\. Restart application server  
   Expected: ✓ In-flight requests handled gracefully  
   Expected: ✓ New requests succeed after restart

3\. Network partition  
   Expected: ✓ System detects partition  
   Expected: ✓ Failover to backup

### **System Testing Environment:**

Production-like "Staging" Environment:

\[Load Balancer\] (Same config as prod)  
       ↓  
\[App Servers\] (Same scale as prod)  
       ↓  
\[Databases\] (Replicated setup)  
       ↓  
\[Cache Layer\] (Redis cluster)  
       ↓  
\[Message Queue\] (RabbitMQ/Kafka)  
       ↓  
\[External APIs\] (Sandbox/mocked)

As close to production as possible\!

**Key characteristics:**

* 🎭 **End-to-end scope:** Entire system, all components  
* 🌍 **Production-like environment:** Realistic infrastructure  
* 📋 **Requirements verification:** Does it meet all specs?  
* 🔄 **Multiple user workflows:** Real usage scenarios
