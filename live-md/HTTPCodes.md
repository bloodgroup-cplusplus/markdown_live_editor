## **🚦 15\. HTTP Status Codes: The Traffic Lights of the Web**

Status codes are the API's way of saying "Here's what happened with your request."

### **The Universal Pattern:**

* **2xx \= Success** ✅ "All good\!"  
* **3xx \= Redirect** ↪️ "Go look over there"  
* **4xx \= Client Error** 🚫 "You messed up"  
* **5xx \= Server Error** 💥 "We messed up"

---

## **✅ 2xx Success: "Mission Accomplished\!"**

### **200 OK \- The Universal Success**

**Restaurant:** "Here's your food, exactly as ordered"

**When you see it:** GET, PUT, PATCH requests succeeded

| GET /posts/42Response: 200 OKBody: { "id": 42, "title": "Hello World" } |

### **201 Created \- "Successfully Made\!"**

**Restaurant:** "Your order is placed and here's your receipt number"

**When you see it:** POST request successfully created something

| POST /postsResponse: 201 CreatedLocation: /posts/43Body: { "id": 43, "title": "New Post" } |

**When you see it:** DELETE succeeded, or update with no content to return

## **↪️ 3xx Redirects: "Not Here, Try There"**
