# **Software Testing:**

#  **The New Car Mystery**

Imagine you just built a car from scratch. Before selling it, what would you test?

**Think about different scenarios:**

* Does the engine start? (Basic functionality)
* Do all doors open? (Individual components)
* Can it drive on the highway? (Complete journey)
* Does the radio work while driving? (Components working together)
* What happens in a 10-car pile-up? (Extreme stress)
* Can it handle 100,000 miles? (Long-term reliability)

**Pause and think:**

Would you test these all at once?

Would you test in a specific order?

What if you only had time for one test before the customer arrives?

### **The Answer: Different Testing Types for Different Goals**

Just like testing a car requires multiple approaches, software testing has different types for different purposes:

**Smoke Testing:**

"Does it turn on?"

**Functional Testing:**

"Does each feature work?"

**Integration Testing:**

"Do parts work together?"

**System Testing:**

"Does the complete system work?"

**API Testing:**

"Do the interfaces work correctly?"

**E2E Testing:**

"Can a user complete their journey?"

**Stress Testing:**

"What breaks it?"

**Chaos Testing:**

"Can it survive disasters?"

**Key Insight:** No single test type is enough\! You need a testing strategy that combines different approaches at different stages\!

## **🏗️ The Testing Pyramid: Foundation of Test Strategy**

Before diving into each type, understand how they relate:

**Mental model:** Like building inspections:

* **Bottom (Unit/Functional):** Individual bricks are solid
* **Middle (Integration):** Walls are properly connected
* **Top (System/E2E):** Entire building is safe to occupy
* **Stress/Chaos:** Building survives earthquakes

## **💨 Smoke Testing: "Does It Even Work?"**

### **What is Smoke Testing?**

Smoke testing (aka sanity testing) is the **quickest, most basic check** to verify the software isn't fundamentally broken.

**Origin of the name:** When hardware engineers power on a circuit board, they check if smoke comes out. No smoke \= safe to proceed with more tests\!

### **Real-World Analogy:**

**Like checking a house before showing it to buyers:**

Quick 5-minute walkthrough:

✓ Does the front door open?

✓ Do lights turn on?

✓ Is there electricity?

✓ Does water run?

If YES →

Show the house

If NO →

Fix critical issues first\!

### **Smoke Test Examples:**

#### **Web Application:**

Smoke Test Suite (runs in 2 minutes):

1\. Can user load homepage?


```bash
   GET https://app.com/

   Expected: 200 OK ✅ |
  ```

2\. Can user log in?

```bash
  POST /login with valid credentials

Expected: Redirect to dashboard ✅
```

3\. Can user see their data?


```bash

 GET /api/user/profile
 ````


 Expected: Returns user JSON ✅

4\. Is database responding?



   Simple query:
  ```bash

   SELECT 1

   Expected: Returns result ✅ |
   ```

If ALL pass → Deploy to QA environment
If ANY fail → Roll back immediately\!

#### **E-commerce Platform:**

Critical path smoke tests:

□ Homepage loads

□ Search works

□ Product page displays

□ Add to cart functions

□ Checkout button appears

If these fail, nothing else matters\!

### **When to Run Smoke Tests:**

Development Pipeline:

1) Code Commit

2) Build

3) [Smoke Tests]

4) Pass? → Full Test Suite

    ↓

   FAIL

    ↓

5) Notify developer immediately\!

6) Don't waste time on broken build

**Key characteristics:**

* ⚡ **Fast:** 2-10 minutes maximum
* 🎯 **Critical path only:** Test what matters most
* 🚨 **First line of defense:** Catch obvious breaks
* 🔄 **Run frequently:** After every build/deploy
